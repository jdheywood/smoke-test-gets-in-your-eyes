### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone this repository
* Install Ruby 1.9.3; If on Windows use the installer, it's easier: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ if on *nix or Mac have at it. If you have multiple versions of Ruby then you are a mad man, but this may help on Windows; https://github.com/vertiginous/pik or for *nix and Mac; http://rvm.io/
* Install Bundler; $ gem install bundler
* Navigate to the root of your cloned repo
* Use bundler to install the projects dependencies; $ bundle install
